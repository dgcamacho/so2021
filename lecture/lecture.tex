\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The focus of this module lies on aspects of software development like programming on high-performance computers,
object-oriented software design, generic (template-based) programming, and the efficient implementation of
numerical algorithms. Additionally experience in analysis, application and extension of software and software
libraries is developed. This module in the winter term especially focuses on software development with the
programming language C++.

Three main learning goals can be formulated:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item You know how to program with modern C++, using generic programming and advanced techniques, like meta
  programming, expression templates, and concepts.
  \item You know how to use programming tools and you can apply these tools to debug, benchmark, and manage your
  code. The list of tools include compilers, build systems, version control, debuggers, and profilers.
  \item You can read, understand, and utilize (scientific) software libraries, like BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra
  Subroutines), LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package), STL (Standard template library), Dune (framework for the
  discretization of partial differential equations), MTL4 (Matrix Template Library), Boost (portable C++ library).
\end{enumerate}

There are exercises every week to practice the C++ programming. During the semester programming projects in groups
are assigned.

These lecture notes are partially based on a bool manuscript by Peter Gottschling \cite{gottschling2016}, The book
``C++ kurz \& gut'' \cite{loudon2013}, and ``Die C++-Programmiersprache'' \cite{stroustrup2000}. It is continuously
developed since the initial lecture in So2014. This is \textit{work in progress} and may contain typos and errors
that need to be corrected in future releases of the notes. Please feel free to submit any correction.
