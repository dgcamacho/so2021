# Exercises for the lecture Scientific Programming - Advanced Concepts

**Dr. Simon Praetorius**

simon.praetorius@tu-dresden.de

There will be an exercise sheet every week with some exercises to be worked on during the tutorial and some to be
submitted for review. The submission procedure is briefly described on the lecture repository startpage

https://gitlab.mn.tu-dresden.de/teaching/scprog/wi2019

and follows the way of code submission in many (scientific) software projects. Thus, it is a good way of learning
and training collaborative coding.

Code submission and code storage is organized using the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system and the data is hosted
at the MatNat GitLab platform. Access to this platform is established during the first weeks in the semester. Therefore,
you need to register to the tutorial part of the lecture in [selma](https://selma.tu-dresden.de).

Additionally to the submission of your own code, the exercise sheets and lecture notes are provided in this Git repository.
