# Exercises for the lecture SCPROG in the winter term 2019/20

**Tutor:** Dr. Simon Praetorius (simon.praetorius@tu-dresden.de)

There will be an exercise sheet every week with some exercises to be worked on during the tutorial and some to be
submitted for review. The submission procedure is briefly described on the lecture repository [README.md](/README.md) page and follows the way of code submission in many (scientific) software projects.
Thus, it is a good way of learning and training collaborative coding.

Code submission and code storage is organized using the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system and the data is hosted
at the MatNat [GitLab](https://gitlab.mn.tu-dresden.de) platform. Access to this platform is established during the first weeks
in the semester.

Additionally to the submission of your own code, the exercise sheets and lecture notes are provided in this Git repository.
